# Simple Naive Bayes Classifier

Not a big deal. Simple, functional Java Naive Bayes Probabilistic model implementation.
Helps to compute the fit between a new observation and some previously observed data.
Seems it works well enough in practice.

Sample data are obtained from Eric Meisner's Naive Bayes Classifier example:

And formula :

Doesn't include "m-estimate of probability", means you're welcome to modify it to work with exact numbers like "height", "width" etc.

Source code is commented enough, I hope it helps someone somewhere.
